    <string name="about"><![CDATA[Hi! Welcome to <b><i>Digit Recognizer</i></b>.
    This app an Artificial Intelligence class project.
    The app is simple in it\'s concept but rather intriguing.
    <br/><br/>When you click the button <b>Try it out</b> from the main menu
    you\'ll be taken to a canvas where you
    can draw out a digit from 0 do 9. After you are done, click <b>Solve</b> and the app will try
    to recognize the digit using a neuron network that has been trained on a significant data set
    of 10000 images of handwritten digits. Make sure you are connected to the internet when using
    the app as it uses it to communicate with our server.
    <br/><br/>We hope you will have fun and we hope that this
    app makes you want to research more about AI, neuron networks and image processing.
    <br/><br/><i>This app was created by Denis SelimoviÄ‡ & Lamija Vrnjak at the Faculty of
     Electrical Engineering of Sarajevo.</i>]]></string>
